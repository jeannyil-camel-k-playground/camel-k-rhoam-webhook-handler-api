# Camel-K-RHOAM-Webhook-Handler-Api project

This project leverages **Red Hat Integration - Camel K 1.x**.

## NOTE
- [`Jitpack`](https://jitpack.io/) is used to package the [message-models](./message-models) project into a shared JAR that will be used by the `RhoamWebhookEventsHandlerApi` integration. 
- This configuration is handy but experimental and it may change in future versions. **In a production scenario, the model JAR should be deployed into your own Maven registry and be referenced in the platform configuration**.
